we're working on it, ok?


Hello World 


Ok, in theory git can handle us both editing the same text file through *magic* so I'm not gonna bother with the dump folders, unless you want to use them to store junk files, in which case we can talk about a .gitignore file


Here's an explanation of the directories I made
..*proposalDrafts: tex files and pdfs related to our actual proposal
..*resources: tex files and pdfs with equations, books, maybe a running list of URL's of resources we use and how we use them (we should learn to use bibtex for this part but bibtex ishard and I'm a baby)
..*figures: any images we might come across that will be useful

This list can be appended, and you can make new files and stuff as you see fit. Right now I'm using it as a message board but that's not normally how READMEs are structured so I'll probably edit this to be prettier at some point
